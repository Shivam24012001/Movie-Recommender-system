# Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. Using **machine learning**, **Python**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, the system analyzes movie data and provides personalized recommendations.

---

## 🔢 Data Used
The dataset contains information such as movie titles, genres, ratings, user reviews, and popularity.  
Columns include:
- `movie_id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `title`: Movie name.
- `genres`: Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.
- `ratings`: User ratings (1–5 stars).
- `user_id`: Unique user ID.

---

## 🛠️ Project Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset using **Pandas**.
- Handle missing values (e.g., filling missing ratings with the average).
- Convert categorical data (e.g., genres) into numerical form using techniques like **one-hot encoding**.
- Normalize or scale numerical values for better model performance.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the most popular movies based on ratings.
- Find correlations between genres and user preferences.
- Visualize rating distributions using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

### 3️⃣ Building the Recommendation System
#### 🔹 **Approach 1: Content-Based Filtering**
- Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to analyze movie descriptions, genres, or other metadata.
- Finds similarities between movies using **cosine similarity** and suggests movies with similar content.

#### 🔹 **Approach 2: Collaborative Filtering**
- Uses user-item interactions to recommend movies based on users with similar tastes.
- Implemented using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** or other matrix factorization techniques.

#### 🔹 **Approach 3: Hybrid Model**
- Combines **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** for better recommendations.

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation & Results
- Evaluates the accuracy of recommendations using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** or other ranking metrics.
- Compares results from different filtering techniques.
